      <div class="internalcontainer1"><h4>Food Ordering App</h4><br><img class="portimg" src="foodapp.jpg" alt="a picture of the home page of the food app">
        <br><br>One of the first projects I did while studying multimedia design was creating a food ordering app called My Pantry.
        <br><br>
        The concept of this app is that the customer writes what ingredients they have at home.
        <br>The app then suggests a recipe based on that.
        <br>The ingredients the customer dont have for the recipe they can order from the app and then get delivered to the door.
        <br><br>I came up with this concept to make cooking at home much more efficient.
        <br>This app was fully created in Adobe XD, the logo drawn by myself as well.</div>
      <div class="internalcontainer2"><h4>Logo Design w/ Morfars Havehus</h4><br><img class="portimg" src="logo2.jpg" alt="a picture of the logo for morfars havehus">
        <br><br>This one is one of my personal projects.
        <br>In summer 2021 I got asked to design a logo for a second hand shop called Morfars Havehus (eng. Grandpa’s Gardenhouse)
        <br><br>They pretty much didn't have any requirements except that it had to look old fashioned and it had to include a green and blue heart.
        <br>I designed and drew the whole logo on my tablet.
      </div>
      <div class="internalcontainer3"><h4>Moving Art Project</h4><br><img class="portimg" src="movingart.jpg" alt="a picture of my moving art animation">
        <br><br>This was one of the more experimental projects I have done.
        The goal with this project was to create an animation using cut out pieces of an artwork.
        <br>I used Girl with a Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer.
        <br><br>The story of my animation is that she takes a picture of herself and then she turns into a cat, and then bawls her eyes out.
        <br>Dont ask me how i came up with that, because i literally have no idea.
        <br>My brain can be a scary place sometimes.
        <br><br>This project was created using only Adobe Photoshop and Animate, and was my first time using them.
        <br>Let me tell you...after i did this project Photoshop, Animate and me are not good friends.</div>

      <div class="internalcontainer4"><h4>Redesign of Website</h4><br><img class="portimg" src="bold.jpg" alt=" a picture of the logo created for bold.dk">
        <br><br>This was my first big group project.
        <br>With this project we had to redesign an already existing website which we deemed needed a glow up.
        <br><br>The website my group decided to redesign was Bold.dk which is a football news site.
        <br>Here we made a new home page, news page and about page. We even did a redesign of their logo as well to fit their brand more.
        <br><br>This project was made entirely in Adobe XD, which at this point in time is my favorite adobe program.
        <br>**Looks angrily at Animate and Photoshop**

      <div class="internalcontainer5"><h4>Instillation Project w/ Naturama</h4><br><img class="portimg" src="discnat.jpg" alt="a picture of the flyer for discover naturama">
        <br><br><b>T</b>his project was my second big group project.
        <br>For this project we worked together with a natural history museum Naturama to make one of their exhibits more exciting and alive using technology.
        <br>My group made an Augmented Reality game app called DiscoverNaturama.
        <br><br><b>F</b>or this project I also designed the flyer that we passed around at a conference we held to showcase our app.
        <br>You can see 3 sides of the flyer in the picture above, which was created using only Adobe InDesign.
      </div>
      <div class="internalcontainer6"><h4>Animation Project</h4><br><img class="portimg" src="drop.jpg" alt="a picture of my paint drop animation">
        <br><br>This is the most recent project that I have done.
        <br>The premise of this project was to learn how to create animations using html and css.
        <br><br>For my animation I chose to make a drop of paint that falls and splatters on the ground.
        <br>Again…don't ask me how I came up with this.
        <br>it's so random that i don't even know why myself.
        <br><br>First I drew every single frame of the animation in Adobe Illustrator and then threw it into a css stylesheet and made it into an animation.
